# Gesture Recognition for HCI

A MATLAB-based real-time hand gesture recognition system using HOG features and SVM classifier. Detects gestures from webcam feed for Human-Computer Interaction.

## Features
- Train on custom gesture dataset
- Predict hand gestures in real-time
- Display detected gestures on video

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2018 or later
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Webcam support

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add gesture images in `gesture_dataset/` folder (subfolders for each gesture).
3. Run `gesture_recognition.m`.
4. Real-time gestures will be displayed on webcam feed.
